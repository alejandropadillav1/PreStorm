PrsStorm is a ultra-lightweight HTTP client for ArcGIS Server feature services.  It is designed to work with a variety of technologies (i.e. ASP.NET Razor, WPF, MVVM, Esri Runtime APIs, Mono/Xamarin), but it won't get in the way of your business logic.

- super-minimal object-relational mapping
- dynamic field access via indexers
- intuitive and optimized CRUD operations
- generic geometry typing
- sophisticated memoization optimizations
- optional automatic coded-value domain mapping
- server max return count overriding
- parallel downloading via PLINQ
- built-in local geometry functions
- internally managed self-renewing token
- "geodatabase version" support
- automatic handling of INotifyPropertyChanged (via Reflection.Emit but memoized)
- flexible and succinct KML generation
- implicit conversion operators for JSON geometries
- support for extra ArcGIS Rest query string parameters
- Unicode tested
- no dependencies on IDE tools or XML mapping files
